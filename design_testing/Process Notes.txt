In this experiment, we have both GPD and ZEV reads - these are of different lengths, breaking an assumption in the current analysis pipeline.
Although we know what sequences we want to see, many are going to be mis-assemblies of one kind or another. Not including these will make it impossible
to accurately normalize by the cell count/read count ratio for each bin.
Solution: run 'fastq_to_bin.py' twice, once for each length. This will yield two read tables, one for each length (GPD and ZEV). Use exact alignment to merge reads.
Join the tables, and do mean extraction. Select out the desired sequences.

Step-by-step workflow:
Run PEAR on raw MiSeq output
Create directories:
~/facs-seq_test/design_testing/
~/facs-seq_test/design_testing/fastq
~/facs-seq_test/design_testing/miseq_GPD
~/facs-seq_test/design_testing/miseq_ZEV

move resulting FASTQ files to ~/facs-seq_test/design_testing/fastq
run ./assign_bins_miseq_design_testing_GPD.sh; final reads are ~/facs-seq_test/design_testing/miseq_GPD/merged_reads_final.txt
run ./assign_bins_miseq_design_testing_ZEV.sh; final reads are ~/facs-seq_test/design_testing/miseq_ZEV/merged_reads_final.txt
run ./build_table_exact_design_testing_GPD.sh; final read table is ~/facs-seq_test/design_testing/miseq_GPD/final_merged_reads_GPD.csv
run ./build_table_exact_design_testing_ZEV.sh; final read table is ~/facs-seq_test/design_testing/miseq_ZEV/final_merged_reads_ZEV.csv
run ./merge_read_tables; final read table is at ~/facs-seq_test/design_testing/merged_read_table.csv
run ./fit_means_all.sh; final means are at ~/facs-seq_test/design_testing/final_means.csv
run ./get_experiment_ids.sh



### Things to check during analysis ###

Histogram of read lengths in the raw FASTQ files coming out of PEAR, to ensure there isn't a large population of things that are the wrong length,
that get rejected despite having been sorted. (Don't expect this based on PCR gels, but need to check.)

Strengths of control sequences: are there systematic errors due to getting cell counts or bin edges wrong?
	-hard to figure out what's going on here - might have to guess and use the controls to figure it out
